@* Stuff to import to all of our Views *@

@using Platform_Lecture_ASP_MVC_II
@using Platform_Lecture_ASP_MVC_II.Models

@* for Model validation: *@
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

@* to add this to any project from the terminal:
run this command from your project root dotnet new viewimports -o Views/  *@

@* Additionally, you may use this file to provide namespace references to your Views, so that instead of needing 
to reference the full namespace path (for example, @model CoolProj.Models.User), you can provide the @using namespace 
statement here, so that you can refer directly to a class in other files as needed. 

example:
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
@using MyCoolProj.Models
// With this line, you may refer to just the User type when defining the model in your view
// ex: @model User _vs_ @MyCoolProj.Models.User *@
